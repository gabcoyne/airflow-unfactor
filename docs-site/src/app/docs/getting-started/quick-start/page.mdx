# Quick Start

## Analyze a DAG

```json
{
  "tool": "analyze",
  "args": { "path": "dags/my_etl.py" }
}
```

## Convert a DAG

```json
{
  "tool": "convert",
  "args": {
    "path": "dags/my_etl.py",
    "include_comments": true,
    "generate_tests": true
  }
}
```

## Keep Refactors Clean (Project Layout)

If you are migrating into a new Prefect repo, keep generated code structured from day one.

Recommended layout (inspired by `prefecthq/flows` style):

```text
flows/                  # Prefect flow entrypoints
tasks/                  # Reusable task logic
deployments/            # Deployment config/scripts
tests/                  # Flow/task tests
migration/
  airflow_sources/      # Original DAGs for reference
  conversion_notes/     # Runbook outputs and manual follow-up
```

Practical rule:
- Keep Airflow source and generated Prefect code in separate paths.
- Treat runbook output as a tracked migration artifact.
- Promote stable code from `migration/` into first-class `flows/` and `tasks/`.
