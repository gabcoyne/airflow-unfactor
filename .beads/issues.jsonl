Tests should:\n1. Call each task and verify return types\n2. Test the full flow execution\n3. Compare behavior against original DAG where possible\n4. Be runnable immediately after conversion\n\nThis is THE key differentiator - migrations you can trust.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"gabcoyne@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-12T12:33:05.06076-06:00","created_by":"gabcoyne","updated_at":"2026-02-12T12:36:34.644276-06:00","closed_at":"2026-02-12T12:36:34.644293-06:00"}
