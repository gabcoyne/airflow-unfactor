# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** GAPS FOUND
**Score:** 10/18 requirements satisfied

## Requirements Coverage

### 3-Source Cross-Reference

| Req ID | Description | Phase | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | Traceability | Final Status |
|--------|-------------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------|--------------|
| KNOW-01 | KubernetesPodOperator Colin model | Phase 1 | missing (no VERIFICATION.md) | not listed | `[x]` Complete | **partial** |
| KNOW-02 | DatabricksSubmitRunOperator Colin model | Phase 1 | missing | not listed | `[x]` Complete | **partial** |
| KNOW-03 | DatabricksRunNowOperator Colin model | Phase 1 | missing | not listed | `[x]` Complete | **partial** |
| KNOW-04 | SparkSubmitOperator Colin model | Phase 1 | missing | not listed | `[x]` Complete | **partial** |
| KNOW-05 | HttpOperator/SimpleHttpOperator Colin model | Phase 1 | missing | not listed | `[x]` Complete | **partial** |
| KNOW-06 | SSHOperator Colin model | Phase 1 | missing | not listed | `[x]` Complete | **partial** |
| SRVR-01 | Startup warning for missing Colin output | Phase 2 | SATISFIED | listed in 02-02 | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| SRVR-02 | difflib fuzzy suggestions | Phase 2 | SATISFIED | not listed | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| SRVR-03 | Expanded FALLBACK_KNOWLEDGE to 15 entries | Phase 2 | SATISFIED | not listed | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| SRVR-04 | Parse error logging | Phase 2 | SATISFIED | listed in 02-02 | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| KNOW-07 | Azure operators Colin model | Phase 3 | orphaned | — | Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| KNOW-08 | DbtCloudRunJobOperator Colin model | Phase 3 | orphaned | — | Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| KNOW-09 | Extended Jinja macro patterns | Phase 3 | orphaned | — | Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| KNOW-10 | depends_on_past concept entry | Phase 3 | orphaned | — | Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| KNOW-11 | Deferrable operator migration | Phase 3 | orphaned | — | Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| KNOW-12 | Schedule translation in scaffold | Phase 3 | orphaned | — | Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| VALD-01 | Expanded validate checklist | Phase 4 | orphaned | — | Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| VALD-02 | Real-world DAG regression tests | Phase 4 | orphaned | — | Pending | **unsatisfied** |

### Summary

- **Satisfied:** 4 (SRVR-01 through SRVR-04) — full 3-source agreement
- **Partial:** 6 (KNOW-01 through KNOW-06) — traceability says complete, integration checker confirms wiring, but Phase 1 has no VERIFICATION.md
- **Unsatisfied:** 8 (KNOW-07 through KNOW-12, VALD-01, VALD-02) — Phases 3 and 4 never started

## Phase Status

| Phase | VERIFICATION.md | Plans | Status |
|-------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| 1. P1 Knowledge Expansion | MISSING | 3/3 complete | Unverified |
| 2. Server Quality | PASSED (8/8) | 2/2 complete | Verified |
| 3. P2 Knowledge Expansion | Not started | 0/TBD | Not started |
| 4. Validation Hardening | Not started | 0/TBD | Not started |

## Integration Check

**Cross-phase wiring: 10/10 requirements properly wired.**

All Phase 1 Colin JSON files are loaded by Phase 2's improved `load_knowledge()`. Phase 2's `suggestions()` pools Phase 1 operators as fuzzy match candidates. SRVR-01 startup warning fires based on whether Phase 1 output files exist. No orphaned requirement within the completed phases.

**Pre-existing issues (outside milestone scope):**
- `scaffold` tool: `workspace` and `flow_names` parameters silently dropped (accepted but not forwarded)
- `validate_generated_code()` in validation.py is dead code

## Tech Debt

### Phase 1: P1 Knowledge Expansion
- Missing VERIFICATION.md — never formally verified
- SUMMARY frontmatter missing `requirements_completed` in all 3 summaries
- `operators-sftp.json` contains SSHOperator (naming mismatch, no functional impact)

### Phase 2: Server Quality
- SUMMARY frontmatter missing `requirements_completed` in 02-01-SUMMARY.md

### Pre-existing
- `validate_generated_code()` dead code in validation.py

## Test Suite

97 tests passing, 0 failures, 0 regressions across both completed phases.
